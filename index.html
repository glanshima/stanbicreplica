                        Internet banking : You must first register at your nearest branch by filling in a registration form.You will be issued with a password that you have to change once you have logged on to the Internet site for the first time.

                        Verification : You may not create a password using somebody else's bank details. Before we allow you access to Self-Service Banking we may require information from you so that we can verify that you are who you say you are. We will require your prior consent (express or implied), which consent will be deemed to have been granted by you at the time that you sign the registration form referred to in 6 above or at the time you accept these terms and conditions, to perform credit or other checks on you before we process an instruction.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph"><span class="heading">
                        7. Fees</span> For the use of self-service banking you will be charged the following fees:

    a. For Internet banking we may charge you a monthly subscription fee.
    b. We may charge a transaction fee based on the type of transactions you perform. Details of our standard subscription and transaction fees are available on our website and at branches.

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph"><span class="heading">
                        8. We will act on instructions that appear to have been sent by you</span>Use of a communication system means we do not interact face-to-face. Unless you notify us before we give effect to an instruction, you authorize us to rely on and perform all instructions that appear to originate from you (even if someone else is impersonating you).
                    </p>

More information on the turn-around times for processing of instructions is available on our website.An instruction, including purchases of prepaid products, cannot be terminated or revoked once sent to us.

                        An instruction is deemed to be received by us only once we have confirmed we have received it. If we fail to confirm receipt of your instruction, do not re-send the same instruction before checking your statements and contacting our Customer Care Centre. This is because the initial instruction may still be processed and re-sending the instruction may lead to a double transaction for which we will not be held liable.

                        11. Access code protection and irregularities</span>
                    An "access code" refers to your password and user name. You must protect and keep your access codes confidential at all times. It is not safe to store it on your computer or on a network. We rely on you to report any compromise of your access codes to us without delay. You may do this by contacting our Customer Care Centre or your branch. We may ask you to verify your identity to prevent someone else from impersonating you. Once you notify us to disable an access code we are entitled to:

    a. Reject all instructions received after such notification;
    b. Suspend the processing of all instructions not yet executed;
    c. Reverse (if possible) all executed transactions with effect from such date and time as we may reasonably determine the unauthorised use to have commenced;
    d. Deactivate the access code without further notice. There will never be a reason for any person including a member of our staff or Customer Care Centre to know or ask for your access code. Do not disclose an access code to these persons, regardless of whether you called them or they called you. You must immediately notify us if you discover an error or irregularity. You can report any errors to our Customer Care Centre or at any branch.
